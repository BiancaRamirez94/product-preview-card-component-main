Project Description
This code is for a Product Preview Card Component. It's an HTML and CSS file used to build a product card that features an image, product information and a button to add the item to the cart. The layout of the product card is mobile-first, with the design being optimized for smaller screens, but it also includes responsive design to allow for proper display on larger screens as well.

Instructions
To view the product preview card, open the HTML file in a web browser. The file is linked to a CSS file in the same folder, so both files need to be in the same directory for the product card to display properly.

Dependencies
The code uses Google Fonts for the typography and a product image file stored in the images folder for the image.
